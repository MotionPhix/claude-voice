## 🛡️ **Security Layers**

Your system now has **4 layers of security**:

### **Layer 1: Global Scopes** 🔐
- Automatic organization filtering on ALL queries
- Users NEVER see data from other organizations
- Applied via `BelongsToOrganization` trait

### **Layer 2: Middleware** 🚪
- `EnsureOrganizationIsSet` ensures organization context
- Applied globally to all authenticated routes
- Redirects to organization selector if needed

### **Layer 3: Policies** 🛡️
- Role-based authorization on every action
- Organization ownership verification
- Business logic protection

### **Layer 4: Validation** ✅
- Organization ID validation in forms
- Relationship validation (invoice belongs to client in same org)
- Status-based action restrictions

## 🎯 **Real-World Security Scenarios**

### **✅ Scenario 1: User A tries to view Invoice from Organization B**
```
Result: 404 Not Found (Global Scope filters it out)
Policy: Never even checks (resource doesn't exist in query)
```

### **✅ Scenario 2: Manager tries to delete a sent Invoice**
```
Result: 403 Forbidden
Policy: InvoicePolicy->delete() returns false (only draft can be deleted)
```

### **✅ Scenario 3: User role tries to create an Invoice**
```
Result: 403 Forbidden  
Policy: InvoicePolicy->create() returns false (User role cannot create)
```

### **✅ Scenario 4: Accountant tries to update a Client**
```
Result: 403 Forbidden
Policy: ClientPolicy->update() returns false (Accountant cannot update clients)
```

### **✅ Scenario 5: Admin tries to delete the Organization**
```
Result: 403 Forbidden
Policy: OrganizationPolicy->delete() returns false (only Owner can delete)
```

## 🧪 **Testing Phase 2**

### **Quick Manual Test:**

```bash
# 1. Create two organizations with users
# 2. Log in as User 1 from Org 1
# 3. Try to access invoices - should see only Org 1 invoices
# 4. Try to create invoice as "User" role - should get 403
# 5. Switch to "Manager" role - should be able to create
# 6. Try to edit sent invoice - should get redirect with error
```

### **Automated Tests (Phase 2.4):**
```bash
# Coming next:
php artisan make:test PolicyTest --pest
php artisan make:test AuthorizationTest --pest
```

## 💡 **Pro Tips for Using Your New Authorization System**

### **In Controllers:**
```php
// Basic authorization
$this->authorize('update', $invoice);

// Custom error message
$this->authorize('update', $invoice, 'Only draft invoices can be edited');

// Check without throwing exception
if ($request->user()->can('update', $invoice)) {
    // Do something
}
```

### **In Blade/Vue:**
```php
// In Blade
@can('update', $invoice)
    <button>Edit Invoice</button>
@endcan

// In Vue using helpers
<button v-if="canUpdate">Edit</button>
```

### **In API:**
```php
// Policies work the same in API controllers
public function update(Request $request, Invoice $invoice)
{
    $this->authorize('update', $invoice);
    // API logic...
}
```

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

### **Before Deploying to Production:**
1. ✅ Run comprehensive tests (Phase 2.4)
2. ✅ Test all roles thoroughly
3. ✅ Verify data isolation between organizations
4. ✅ Test invitation workflow
5. ✅ Review all policy permissions

### **Performance Considerations:**
- ✅ Global scopes add minimal query overhead
- ✅ Policies are cached by Laravel
- ✅ Helper functions use session (fast)
- ✅ No N+1 query issues introduced

---
