## 🎯 **What Each Test Suite Covers**

### **1. Policy Tests** (4 files, 60+ tests)

#### **InvoicePolicyTest.php**
Tests all invoice authorization scenarios:
- ✅ `viewAny` - All roles can list invoices
- ✅ `view` - All roles can view, cross-org denied
- ✅ `create` - Owner/Admin/Manager only
- ✅ `update` - Only draft invoices, authorized roles
- ✅ `delete` - Only draft invoices, authorized roles
- ✅ `send` - Owner/Admin/Manager only
- ✅ `duplicate` - Owner/Admin/Manager only
- ✅ `downloadPdf` - All roles

#### **ClientPolicyTest.php**
Tests client management authorization:
- ✅ All roles can view clients
- ✅ Only Owner/Admin/Manager can create/update
- ✅ Only Owner/Admin can delete
- ✅ Cross-organization access denied

#### **PaymentPolicyTest.php**
Tests payment authorization:
- ✅ All roles can view payments
- ✅ Owner/Admin/Manager/Accountant can create
- ✅ Owner/Admin/Accountant can update/delete
- ✅ User role blocked from all write operations

#### **OrganizationPolicyTest.php**
Tests organization management:
- ✅ All users can create organizations
- ✅ Members can view their organizations
- ✅ Only Owner/Admin can update settings

---

### **2. Helper Function Tests** (30+ tests)

Tests all 8 helper functions in `app/helpers.php`:

#### **Organization Context Helpers**
- ✅ `current_organization_id()` - Returns ID or null
- ✅ `current_organization()` - Returns model, caches result
- ✅ `set_current_organization()` - Accepts model/ID/null

#### **User & Membership Helpers**
- ✅ `user_organizations()` - Returns user's orgs
- ✅ `current_membership()` - Returns current user's membership
- ✅ `user_can_in_organization()` - Checks permissions
- ✅ `current_user_role()` - Returns role enum
- ✅ `user_has_role()` - Compares roles

#### **Utility Helpers**
- ✅ `ensure_organization()` - Auto-sets first org
- ✅ Edge cases (deleted orgs, rapid switching)

---

### **3. Data Isolation Tests** (20+ tests)

Critical security tests ensuring data separation:

#### **Model Scoping**
- ✅ Clients - Only current org visible
- ✅ Invoices - Only current org visible
- ✅ Payments - Only current org visible
- ✅ All models respect organization scope

#### **Cross-Organization Security**
- ✅ Cannot query other org's data
- ✅ Relationships respect scope
- ✅ Global scope automatically applied

#### **Organization Switching**
- ✅ Data changes when switching orgs
- ✅ Multi-org users see correct data
- ✅ Scope bypass with `allOrganizations()`

#### **Edge Cases**
- ✅ No data when org not set
- ✅ Cannot create cross-org relationships
- ✅ Multi-organization users work correctly

---

### **4. Authorization Feature Tests** (25+ tests)

Integration tests for HTTP requests:

#### **Invoice Authorization**
- ✅ Manager can create invoice (200)
- ✅ User role blocked from creation (403)
- ✅ Can edit draft, cannot edit sent
- ✅ Deletion permissions enforced
- ✅ Send permissions enforced

#### **Client Authorization**
- ✅ Create/update permissions work
- ✅ Delete restricted to Owner/Admin
- ✅ Forbidden returns 403 status

#### **Cross-Organization Protection**
- ✅ Cannot view other org's invoices (404)
- ✅ Cannot update other org's clients (404)
- ✅ Cannot delete other org's data (404)

#### **View-Only Access**
- ✅ All roles can view resources
- ✅ All roles can download PDFs
- ✅ Read access never blocked

## 🚀 **Running the Tests**

### **Quick Start**

```bash
# Run all multi-tenant tests (recommended)
./run-multi-tenant-tests.bat       # Windows
./run-multi-tenant-tests.sh        # Linux/Mac

# Or run individual test suites
php artisan test tests/Unit/Policies
php artisan test tests/Feature/MultiTenant
php artisan test tests/Unit/HelpersTest.php
```

### **Run Specific Test Categories**

```bash
# Policy tests only
php artisan test tests/Unit/Policies --compact

# Data isolation tests
php artisan test tests/Feature/MultiTenant/DataIsolationTest.php

# Authorization tests
php artisan test tests/Feature/MultiTenant/AuthorizationTest.php --filter="Invoice Authorization"

# Helper tests
php artisan test tests/Unit/HelpersTest.php
```

### **Verbose Output**

```bash
# See detailed test output
php artisan test tests/Unit/Policies

# Filter specific test
php artisan test --filter="allows owner to delete organization"
```

Tests:    135 passed (145 assertions)
Duration: 15s
```

## 🐛 **Common Test Issues & Fixes**

### **Issue 1: "Organization not set" errors**
```php
// Fix: Always set organization in beforeEach
beforeEach(function () {
    set_current_organization($this->organization);
});
```

### **Issue 2: "User not authenticated" errors**
```php
// Fix: Use actingAs in tests
$this->actingAs($this->user);
```

### **Issue 3: Cross-organization tests failing**
```php
// Fix: Ensure you're switching orgs correctly
set_current_organization($otherOrg);
```

### **Issue 4: Factory relationship errors**
```php
// Fix: Use explicit relationships
Invoice::factory()
    ->for($organization)
    ->for($client, 'client')
    ->create();
```

## 📚 **Testing Best Practices Used**

### **1. Descriptive Test Names**
```php
it('prevents user role from creating invoice')
// vs
test('authorization test 1')  // ❌ Bad
```

### **2. Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern**
```php
// Arrange
$invoice = Invoice::factory()->draft()->create();

// Act
$response = $this->delete(route('invoices.destroy', $invoice));

// Assert
$response->assertForbidden();
```

### **3. Test Isolation**
```php
// Each test is independent
beforeEach(function () {
    // Fresh state for every test
});
```

### **4. Comprehensive Coverage**
- Happy paths ✅
- Failure paths ✅
- Edge cases ✅
- Security scenarios ✅
